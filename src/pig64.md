# Pig 64 Guide

This is a page which will instruct someone, on how to obtain all of [Pig 64's](https://www.roblox.com/games/18109142315/PIG-64) badges.
This will not go over how to get the Keymaster's badge from Piggy!

```admonish info
You need to have the [Keymaster's badge](https://www.rolimons.com/gamebadge/1368314122096465) from the main [Piggy](https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862/Piggy) game before proceeding!
The *Subway* and *Mall* maps should be unlocked before doing the quests.
```

```admonish warning
This quest is not possible on console/with a controller due to several things like keypads, pipe puzzles and crafting not being picked up as buttons on a controller. So, it is suggested that players doing this should use a mobile device or PC if possible.
```

## Potato Pout ![PotatoPout](/img/potpout.png)

1. Use the *Glitch Key* given automatically by the Keymaster badge to open the glitched door in Subway. Interact with the crying Mr. P in the corner of the room. After talking to him, you'll want to head to the Arcade map.

2. In the arcade map, there are four tiny levers hidden around the map, you'll want to flip all four of them to get access to the Birdy Bank.

3. Buy the *Big Dice* item for 60 tokens. Follow the cord going from the vault to a room in the arcade. In the room where the cord ends, use the *Big Dice* four times. The numbers it lands on at the end of each use are the four digits in order required for the vault code.

```admonish
The dice should light up green in the correct room. If the dice is not green, you are in the wrong room!
```

4. Go inside the vault and talk to the NPC.

5. Go to Subway again and enter the building window with the Mrs. P silhouette on it, which is accessible by jumping from the hotel building into the room. Grab the Mrs. P photo lying on the ground.

6. Give the Mrs. P photo to Mr.P. He will start crying and will flood the city.

## Deep Depths

1. Activate the five valves across the flooded Subway, there are three in the city and two in the subway. They can be found next to the white grates.
   - *The Flippers* item from the shop can be bought to speed this part up.

2. Next, buy the *Infinite Jar of Coins* and the *Boombox*. This is needed for the next part.

3. Go to the Arcade and find the claw machine on the bottom floor.

4. Move the claw using the songs on the *Boombox*.

```admonish example
A song's capital letter indicates what direction the claw will move. For example, *rUmble* moves the claw up.
Use *Dimension* to lower the claw.
```

5. Collect the purple potato from the claw machine.

6. Go back to Subway map and give the potato to Mr. P. This will drain all of the water from the map and leave behind his hat, which can be picked up and worn by the player once equipped.
